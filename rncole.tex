\section*{Professional Experience}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
2011--pres.&{\bf Senior Structural Engineer at \fontsize{12}{12}\textsc{MS Technology Inc., Y-12 NSC}}\\
&As a senior structural engineer, I was responsible for management of a multi-disciplinary team of engineers and designers ensuring that project milestones are met.  Management responsibilities included preparation of project reports on pipe/structure seismic interaction, equipment seismic qualification, and driving necessary engineering design and process improvements to facilitate efficient production of deliverables resulting in project cost savings while assisting and mentoring junior engineers.  Project management involvement included estimation, scheduling, and assignment of design activities, and reviewing of inter-discipline and vendor submittals.  

\par
Structures designed included platform structures and torsional analysis of open steel sections, multi-story modular, and stainless steel structures supporting turn-key systems comprised of mechanical, EI\&C, process equipment and piping; these designs involved preparing, checking, and verifying structural calculations, drawings and 3D modeling as well as disposition of field change requests and safely performing field walkdowns.   Design work performed involved extensive use of GT STRUDL including dynamic, linear, time-history analysis, and producing in-structure response spectra.  Software utilized also involved testing, verification, and validation to ensure quality.\\[6pt]

\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}

2008--2011&{\bf Civil/Structural Engineer at \fontsize{12}{12}\textsc{Bechtel Power Corp., TVA WBN2 Completion}}\\
&For the Watts Bar Unit 2 project I was responsible for the scheduling, management, and completion of all Civil design packages for the Unit 2 Reactor Building and Turbine Building.  In this role I also interfaced regularly with the client, vendors, sub-contractors, field engineers, craft, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Towards project completion I aggressively pursued completion of the ‘Task Engineering’ effort and supported all disciplines to ensure compliance, uniformity, and expedition of deliverables while also participating in a Six-Sigma team to streamline the issuance of design packages for an estimated project savings of \$1-2 million.  I also completed the Bechtel Supervisory Development Program.

\par
As an individual contributor I generated structural design packages including design calculations and drawings and prepared nuclear licensing/technical basis documents for retrofitting steel connections on safety-related structures.  Designed components and structures included steel platforms, equipment supports, base plates, concrete anchors, reinforced concrete pads and footings and other miscellaneous civil commodities.  Design documents I produced included preparing, checking, and verifying design calculations, drawings, and field changes involving structural steel and concrete.  To this end I also conducted field walkdowns to analyze and document existing plant conditions and feasibility of changes for numerous structural commodities.\\[6pt]
